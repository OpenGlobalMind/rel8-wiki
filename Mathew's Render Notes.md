# Mathew's Render Notes

I decided to try scribing one of the Betaworx Render sessions (specifically: the #Plexus demo) using Obsidian, and try publishing it via GitHub. [Context here](https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=conference+report&types=like&types=do&types=think&timeframe=anytime&quality=all&tags=betaworx). Hopefully [[Jerry Michalski]] will allow me to simply commit it to the Rel8 wiki ;)

Plexus founder Davey Morse starts with a good question that I don't hear nearly enough in this space: *What will it take for the things we're building here to have an impact out there, on people who aren't coders, researchers or productivity experts?*

(My answer, FWIW: **a lot**, including a self-sustaining business model and a commitment to the lambda user I don't see a lot of around here.)

The background to this question is that none of his friends thought the first 2 note-taking tools he built were worth the effort. They didn't see what he could see. Sounds familiar.

Plexus was launched for the Render conference Now, a few days later, an OpenAI outage stymied my revisit - a shame. Anyway, the idea is simple:
* post your thoughts into a defined shared brain on Plexus - eg : https://render.plexus.earth/
* the AI surfaces relevant thoughts from other people in the same shared brain
* you can dis/agree 
* if you agree that the surfaced thought you "pin" it
* you can even email the author

As he pointed out, everywhere you go - as long as you're not in the desert - you see all those potential life-changing connections between pairs of people which are not happening. He believes AI is the answer, but I fear it'll be gamed just like everything else (SEO, hashtags).

My first reaction at the time: https://twitter.com/mathewlowry/status/1560359969865797633 - my first online community was for a 2002 physical conference, so the first thing I saw was a mobile app for visitors exploring physical spaces like conferences, exhibitions. Just add a "meet me here" button, and the online and offline networking would be brilliantly complementary.

They're open to pilots. I could easily imagine trying this out here in Brussels.
