# Inoculate The Big Fungus

*To give our shared memory a boost into orbit.* 

What is a shared memory? Where does it live? These are harder questions to answer than what is Wikipedia? 

In order to give our shared memory some metaphoric shape, we've borrowed mycelial connections to describe [[The Big Fungus]]. 

Further extending the metaphor, the Fungus needs data, so we're going to "inoculate" it with data from [[Jerry's Brain]]. 

Then we'll add other [[Collections to Feed the Big Fungus]].
