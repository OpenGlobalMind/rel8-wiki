# Open Global Mind

[OGM](https://www.openglobalmind.com/) is a community of practice that started when lockdown started, inspired by a vision to help humans make better decisions together. 

The community has several standing weekly calls (all posted to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLreQNsM8LqWA2ib_Yfkde8m30ANi0WtJr)), a [Slack-like chat server](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/), its own wiki and some open-source code developed by community members.
