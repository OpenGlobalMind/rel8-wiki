# Convene Three Neighbor Communities

Rel8 has many "[neighboring](https://bra.in/7jL4YN)" communities. One of our goals is to bring these communities into closer contact, so that they may play together better over time. 

This project will invite several of these neighbors, with the intent to convene three of them into a conversation where we might address:

- What do our projects have in common? Where do they touch?
- How might our projects share data? 
- What does sensemaking mean to each of us?
