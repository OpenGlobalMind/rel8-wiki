# Fellowship of the Link

This subgroup of OGM spun out of a few impromptu Zoom calls with folks who place high value on permalinks, open data sharing, and other ways that our information Commons might be made more useful and accessible. 

These calls are pretty geeky and take place every Wednesday. [Ping Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) if you'd like to be added.
