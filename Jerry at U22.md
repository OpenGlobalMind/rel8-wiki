# Jerry at U22

[Unfinished 22](unfinished.ro) in Bucharest, that is. 

My speech on Saturday (Oct. 1) is titled A Worldview Built from Contrarians. The slide deck is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AL3saMFwLrzAIRzUpSB6GlFJmYQbTa5DJDoJxFStqUc/edit?usp=sharing), and my Brain notes for it are [here](https://bra.in/4jXD9y). 

I'll be holding office hours each of the three days of the conference, AMA style. 

If you connect over LinkedIn, please mention we met at U22.
