# Where Is Rel8? Status as 2023 Begins

### The Situation

- [[Tools for Thinking]] are hot
- But they are all too often solo tools. Big missed opportunity for collective intelligence. 
- Plus, the vendors and communities aren't cross-pollinating much.

### Pragmatic Aspirations

- Why is it so hard to share notes?
- Protocols for sharing notes
- Lessons from group shared notes
- What does [[Multiplayer Sensemaking]] look like?

## Highest Aspirations

- [[Make Better Decisions Together]]
- [[Level up Media]] 
- [[Discover Humanity's Next Operating System]]
	- See Alan Kay, Doug Engelbart, Steve Jobs, JCS Licklider, Ivan Sutherland, Ted Nelson
- [[Save Civilization]]
 
### Make Better Decisions Together



### Save Civilization

- We're amnesic
- Because we don't have a shared memory
	- Which makes us easy to spin and manipulate
	- We outsourced our memories to Google and Wikipedia; it was a mistake
- Building such a shared memory (which is complicated) will help us:
	- Share what we know
	- Transform education, journalism, art, science, elections and policy making
	- Mitigate (neutralize?) the very effective misinformation campaigns afoot
	- Help us face current crises and aim higher


## What This Sector Needs Now

- Vision
	- Keep illustrating the big picture, the [[Highest Aspirations]] as well as the [[Pragmatic Aspirations]]
	- Bootstrap: Use Tools for Thinking to illustrate this process
	- - Tell stories. Narrate this journey
	- Motivate toolsmiths to add storytelling features to all the tools
	- Podcast: [[Tools for Thinking Podcast|Tools for Thinking]]
- Convenings
	- Host virtual events 
		- [[Open Global Mind]] calls
		- [[Free Jerry's Brain]] calls
		- [[Fellowship of the Link]] calls 
		- Cross-pollination with neighbor communities 
	- Host real events
	- Visit the [[Bonfires on the Horizon]], the many communities building our shared memory
	- Be a neutral convener (technologically, not necessarily politically)
- Examples
	- Be the Chuck Yeager of the global brain
		- Offer a "Starter" (to inoculate the emergent, mycelia's global brain)
			- [[Jerry's Brain]]: 25 years, > 500,000 nodes, ~ 1mm links
	- Foster divergent demos (to fight the tractor beams of the desktop metaphor and Microsoft Office)
	- Model Idea Sex (friendlier than "idea combat" or debate)
- Location
	- Virtual: Sense of Place
		- We know where the Web and Wikipedia are. Where is this shared memory?
		- [[The Big Fungus]] (hard fun)
		- [[The Betterverse]] 
	- Virtual: Orientation
		- Which way is up?
		- Where am I?
		- How do I find my way around the global mind?
	- Physical: A place where this work is rooted (maybe)
		- For purpose and commitment
		- For friction, synchronicity, serendipity
		- For convenings
		- We're wired for place and topography. It grounds us. 
- Projects
	- Design Challenges 
		- [FJB Challenges doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOFLAkSrK5UDksIq6qDa-lREX3qCmTEg4ptKI0eQrnw/edit?usp=sharing)
	- [[Mapping Tools for Thinking]] (the landscape)
		- Major categories of tools
		- Dimensions for comparisons
		- Major categories of protocols, etc. 
		- Overlaps of spider diagrams
		- The landscape [in my Brain](https://bra.in/5qeDMg) 
	- Technical specs to aim for
		- Protocols and APIs (link)
		- Point to existing orgs
		- Wrangling the communities designing and hosting these
- Funding flows for leveling up (Tiles)
- Inspiring Many to Feed (Curate?) the Commons
	- Developers to write toward the Commons
	- Users to publish to the Commons
- Play the role of Bell Labs or Xerox PARC in 21C â€” but decentralized
	- Burbling pot of open innovations

It's a great moment to do this!
- People disillusioned with normal jobs at normal companies
- The Commons is bubbling, needs nourishment



## Why Rel8 Exists

Rel8 is about how we relate observations, insights and evidence, all as a way of making sense of the world together and rediscovering how to relate to people who don't share our opinions or worldview. 

If we don't do this, we'll remain mired in partisan political gridlock, which will get uglier and take our attention off dealing with existing global crises to create a better world, which itself will require world-class collaboration and ingenuity.
