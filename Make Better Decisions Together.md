# Make Better Decisions Together

This may seem like it should fall under [[Pragmatic Aspirations]], but it is challenging. 

The use cases we envision for better decisions range from

- Company choosing a service name and tagline, to
- Town choosing between alternate land-use plans, to
- Politicians deliberating platform planks, to 
- Public health officials setting pandemic mitigation guidelines (with and without public participation).

One of the major reasons to build a persistent shared memory is to avoid each of these decisions starting from scratch. People underestimate the value of curating knowledge over time, as illustrated by [[Jerry's Jimmy Wales Story About the Pope Benedict Page in Wikipedia]].

The communities already fleshing out this territory include:

- Debate and argumentation
- Business Intelligence
- Civic participation
