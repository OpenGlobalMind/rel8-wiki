# Shared Notes Across Six Tools

*To prototype note sharing across software applications, improving interoperability in order to build a shared memory.* 

Some [[Tools for Thinking]] are designed for multiplayer collaboration, but not the majority of them. 

Realistically, mappers and notetakers will have different preferences and workflows, and will gravitate to different tools and platforms. 

To build a useful shared memory, we need to share notes across systems, losing as little information as possible in the process. 

To this end, we will pilot note interchanges between six participants on six different platforms. 

Potential participants: 

- [[Jerry Michalski]] and [[Jerry's Brain]]
- [[Flancian]]'s [[Agora]]
- [[Pete Kaminski]]
- [[Bentley Davis]]
- [[Maggie Appleton]]
- [[Chris Aldrich]]

This exercise is also a way of making the shared memory real, giving it a more memorable presence, like [[The Big Fungus]].

The next step in this path is to [[Co-Write a NeoBook]].
