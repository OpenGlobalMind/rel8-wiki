# Massive Pitch

This page is a [[Tiles|Tile]] proposal. 

Massive Wiki used as PowerPoint. Please watch [this short, simple video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWkwOefBPZY) for context. 

The tl;dr: Imagine that instead of a slide deck that was a single document, a presentation instead was a playlist of pages in a wiki name space. 

This Tile needs code that:
- Marks a wiki page as the playlist for a presentation
- Has a "play" feature on that page that 
	- Goes full screen
	- Adds next/previous capabilities
	- Plays wiki pages in the playlist's order
- Offers minimal functional style settings to satisfy as a presentation
- Not essential: ability to start presenting from an arbitrary page in the playlist (to resume a pitch)
- Advanced and not essential: Slide-sorter view, with the ability to re-order slides

Multiple [HTML5 and Markdown presentation apps](https://bra.in/8qzJw6) exist, many of which are open source. Many of them use dividers inside one document to separate slides, which is not the intention here. But some of that code may be very useful here.
