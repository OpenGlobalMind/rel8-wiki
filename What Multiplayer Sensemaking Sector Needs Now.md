# What Multiplayer Sensemaking Needs Now

- Vision
	- Keep illustrating the big picture, the [[Highest Aspirations]] as well as the [[Pragmatic Aspirations]]
	- Bootstrap: Use Tools for Thinking to illustrate this process
	- - Tell stories. Narrate this journey
	- Motivate toolsmiths to add storytelling features to all the tools
	- Podcast: [[Tools for Thinking Podcast|Tools for Thinking]]
- Convenings
	- Host virtual events 
		- [[Open Global Mind]] calls
		- [[Free Jerry's Brain]] calls
		- [[Fellowship of the Link]] calls 
		- Cross-pollination with neighbor communities 
	- Host real events
	- Visit the [[Bonfires on the Horizon]], the many communities building our shared memory
	- Be a neutral convener (technologically, not necessarily politically)
- Examples
	- Be the Chuck Yeager of the global brain
		- Offer a "Starter" (to inoculate the emergent, mycelia's global brain)
			- [[Jerry's Brain]]: 25 years, > 500,000 nodes, ~ 1mm links
	- Foster divergent demos (to fight the tractor beams of the desktop metaphor and Microsoft Office)
	- Model Idea Sex (friendlier than "idea combat" or debate)
- Location
	- Virtual: Sense of Place
		- We know where the Web and Wikipedia are. Where is this shared memory?
		- [[The Big Fungus]] (hard fun)
		- [[The Betterverse]] 
	- Virtual: Orientation
		- Which way is up?
		- Where am I?
		- How do I find my way around the global mind?
	- Physical: A place where this work is rooted (maybe)
		- For purpose and commitment
		- For friction, synchronicity, serendipity
		- For convenings
		- We're wired for place and topography. It grounds us. 
- Projects
	- Design Challenges 
		- [FJB Challenges doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOFLAkSrK5UDksIq6qDa-lREX3qCmTEg4ptKI0eQrnw/edit?usp=sharing)
	- [[Mapping Tools for Thinking]] (the landscape)
		- Major categories of tools
		- Dimensions for comparisons
		- Major categories of protocols, etc. 
		- Overlaps of spider diagrams
		- The landscape [in my Brain](https://bra.in/5qeDMg) 
	- Technical specs to aim for
		- Protocols and APIs (link)
		- Point to existing orgs
		- Wrangling the communities designing and hosting these
- Funding flows for leveling up (Tiles)
- Inspiring Many to Feed (Curate?) the Commons
	- Developers to write toward the Commons
	- Users to publish to the Commons
- Play the role of Bell Labs or Xerox PARC in 21C â€” but decentralized and open
	- Burbling pot of open innovations
