# Why Rel8 Exists

Rel8 is about how we relate observations, insights and evidence, all as a way of making sense of the world together and rediscovering how to relate to people who don't share our opinions or worldview. 

If we don't do this, we'll remain mired in partisan political gridlock, which will get uglier and take our attention off dealing with existing global crises to create a better world, which itself will require world-class collaboration and ingenuity.
