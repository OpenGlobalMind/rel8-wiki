# Bigger Goals

[[Jerry Michalski|Jerry]] here. In the spirit of treating 2023 like the last year I get to do things on this planet (don't worry: no bad news received), this page lists the things I would like to do. 

### Monthly Projects

1. [[Storytelling of What Works]]
2. [[Shared Notes Across Six Tools]]
3. [[Rethinking the Tools for Thinking Podcast |Redesign the Tools for Thinking Podcast]]
4. [[Present from a NeoDeck]]
5. [[SenseDo One Issue in Depth]]
6. Upload Subset of my Brain to Several T4T Platforms ([[Inoculate The Big Fungus]])
7. Convene a [[Virtual T4T Event]] (Hoedown?)
8. [[Externalize My Writings]]
9. [[Co-Write a NeoBook]] (or three)
10. [[Model Being a Cyborg/Centaur]] (#futureofwork)
11. [[Turbocharge Pattern Languages]]
12. [[Prototype a Funding Mechanism]] (the Tiles-to-Mosaic Code-Bounty Flow)
13. [[Convene Three Neighbor Communities]]

### Criteria: 

- Ease of execution
- Usefulness for Muggles
- Fit with mission
- Interest (pull, from curiosity to passion)
- Availability of funding
- Public relevance, timeliness
- Danger?
- Who cares?

### Considerations: 

- Just making a dent matters
- The bigger pattern matters a lot
- Getting many balls rolling, attracting communities

### Potential focal areas

- Design from Trust 
- Revitalizing Towns
- Regenerative Agriculture
- Political debate
- Credible pandemic response 
- History of computing (T4T Season Two)
- Pattern Languages (distilled wisdom)
- Identity politics and cancel culture 
- Self-Directed Education

Overall goals of leveling up:

- How we make decisions together
- How media works, how we think about it
