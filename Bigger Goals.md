# Bigger Goals

[[Jerry Michalski|Jerry]] here. In the spirit of treating 2023 like the last year I get to do things on this planet (don't worry: no bad news received), this page lists the things I will do this year, motivated by [[What Multiplayer Sensemaking Needs Now]]. 

### Monthly Projects

1. [[Storytelling of What Works]]
2. [[Shared Notes Across Six Tools]]
3. [[Rethinking the Tools for Thinking Podcast |Redesign the Tools for Thinking Podcast]]
4. [[Present from a NeoDeck]]
5. [[SenseDo One Issue in Depth]]
6. [[Inoculate The Big Fungus]] (Upload Subset of [[Jerry's Brain]] to Several T4T Platforms)
7. Convene a [[Virtual T4T Event]] (Hoedown?)
8. [[Externalize My Writings]]
9. [[Co-Write a NeoBook]] (or three)
10. [[Model Being a Cyborg/Centaur]] (#futureofwork)
11. [[Turbocharge Pattern Languages]]
12. [[Prototype a Funding Mechanism]] (the Tiles-to-Mosaic Code-Bounty Flow)
13. [[Convene Six Neighbor Communities]]

The numbers map to the Bigger Goals.

### Criteria for Goal Definition and Sequencing: 

- Ease of execution
- Usefulness for [[Muggles]]
- Fit with mission
- Interest (pull, from curiosity to passion)
- Availability of funding
- Public relevance, timeliness
- Danger?
- Who cares?

### Considerations: 

- These goals are all very intertwingled. See [[Rel8 Bigger Goals Map]]
- Just making a dent matters
- The bigger pattern matters a lot
- This list is plastic. Feedback will make it more effective.
- Movement building: getting many balls rolling, attracting communities

### Potential focal areas (especially for #5, SenseDoing)

- Design from Trust 
- [[Revitalizing Cities]]
- Regenerative Agriculture
- Productive Political Debate
- How Would a Wise Community Handle a Pandemic like Covid?
- History of Computing (T4T Season Two)
- Pattern Languages (distilled wisdom)
- Identity Politics and Cancel Culture 
- Self-Directed Education
- Why Share?
- How Might We End Wars Well?

Overall goals of leveling up:

- How we make decisions together
- How media works, how we think about it
