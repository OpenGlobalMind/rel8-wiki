# Free Jerry's Brain

Jerry's been using TheBrain software now for 25 years, all into a single data file that now has over 525,000 nodes (called Thoughts). You can find this page in his Brain here. 

Alas, TheBrain is proprietary software and currently has no API, so playing with it is limited. The FJB group has been experimenting with Brain data, understanding what makes TheBrain particularly useful (to Jerry), and extending those ideas toward a broader Open Global Mind meta-platform. 

FJB calls are pretty geeky, held every Monday. [Ping Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) if you'd like to be added.
