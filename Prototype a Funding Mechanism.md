# Prototype a Funding Mechanism

Building [[The Big Fungus]] in the Commons will require open-source code that solves myriad issues. 

We envision a means of defining what code modules to build by having projects design [[Mosaics]] that describe their low-resolution futures, composed of [[Tiles]] that are code modules. 

The Tiles could be described, compared and rationalized, then funded with Code Bounties.
