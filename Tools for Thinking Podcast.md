# Tools for Thinking Podcast

We've kicked off our quest to level up the [[Tools for Thinking]] space with a "Render" session on August 16 2022 at betaworks in NYC (see [[Scribing Tools for Thinking|the notes]] we took during the event). 

Our mid-term goal is to attract startups in this space to participate in an accelerator program called [Think Camp](https://www.betaworks.com/camp). 

As a bridge, and also as a fun way to explore the space, we're starting a **Tools for Thinking Podcast** where we'll interview the people writing code, using the tools and framing the space. 

We'll drop an episode a week, weaving what we learn and who we meet into this wiki. We'll publish a video version on YouTube, and an audio-only version through Anchor to several podcast broadcasters.
