# What Should Rel8â€™s Structure Be?

## Goals
- Nurture a layer of notes, insights, arguments, evidence "above" Wikipedia and the Web
	- Created by individuals in collaborating communities 
	- Using *different* tools and approaches
	- Connected through protocols and APIs
	- Useful to many disciplines, movements
- Demonstrate that usefulness 
	- Stand up prototypes to inspire vendors and participants
	- Launch challenges that solve problems
- Open-source the resulting code
- Crowdsource a [[Mapping Tools for Thinking|map]] of the Tools for Thinking sector 
- Encourage individuals and software vendors to share what they curate
- Recruit [[Neighboring Organizations]] to the common cause
- Name it, build a common vocabulary across user communities
- Marshal and guide stewards to curate it

## Forces
- Curating the protocols and APIs that make this work

## Why me?
