	- Stand up prototypes to inspire vendors and participants
	- Launch challenges that solve problems
- Open-source the resulting code
- Crowdsource a [[Mapping Tools for Thinking|map]] of the Tools for Thinking sector 
- Encourage individuals and software vendors to share what they curate
- Recruit [[Neighboring Organizations]] to the common cause
