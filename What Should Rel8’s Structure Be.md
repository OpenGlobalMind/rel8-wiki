# What Should Rel8â€™s Structure Be?

## Goals
- Nurture [[The Big Fungus]]: a layer of notes, insights, arguments, evidence "above" Wikipedia and the Web
- Created by collaborating communities using different tools and approaches
- Connected through protocols and APIs
- Useful to many disciplines, movements
	- Demonstrate that usefulness 
- Stand up prototypes to inspire vendors and participants
- Marshal and guide stewards of The Big Fungus
## Forces
- Getting individuals and software vendors to share what they curate
- Curating the protocols and APIs that make this work
## Benchmarks
- Open standards bodies like IETF, W3C, 
- Semi-private initiatives like Danny Hillis's [Knowledge Futures Group](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/)
