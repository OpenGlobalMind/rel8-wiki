# Save Civilization

- We're [amnesic](https://youtube.com/shorts/buzLBikvhNM?feature=share) and paralyzed 
	- We're drowning in the info-torrent
	- With no place to put things we think are worth remembering
- We're amnesic because we don't have a shared memory
	- We are easy to spin and manipulate
	- We outsourced our memories to Google and Wikipedia; that was a mistake
- We're paralyzed because our mutual trust is low
- Building a shared memory (which is complicated) will help us:
	- Share what we know, comparing notes and improving our conclusions
	- Transform education, journalism, art, science, elections and policy making
	- Mitigate (neutralize?) the very effective misinformation campaigns afoot
	- Help us face current crises and aim higher
- Building a memory without addressing trust will fail. 
	- We need both heart and brain engaged.
	- Doing both, together, might be transformative
