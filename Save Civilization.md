# Save Civilization

- We're [amnesic](https://youtube.com/shorts/buzLBikvhNM?feature=share) and paralyzed 
- Because we don't have a shared memory
	- Which makes us easy to spin and manipulate
	- We outsourced our memories to Google and Wikipedia; it was a mistake
- Because our mutual trust is low
- Building such a shared memory (which is complicated) will help us:
	- Share what we know
	- Transform education, journalism, art, science, elections and policy making
	- Mitigate (neutralize?) the very effective misinformation campaigns afoot
	- Help us face current crises and aim higher
- Building a memory without addressing trust will fail
- Doing both, together, might be transformative
