# Storytelling of What Works

All too often, well-intentioned organizations and individuals try to help communities that really need help by imposing plans, processes, tools and structures that the helpers "know" work. But those change efforts often stall or slip. 

Much stickier is change that starts from the community in question. Problem is, those folks are often so overwhelmed or resource-constrained that they have little idea of what's possible from their situation. 

A solution: make quick, simple stories available that illustrate what other communities have done, which has helped them.
