# Rethinking the Tools for Thinking Podcast

We've wrapped Season One of the [[Tools for Thinking Podcast]]. This page is to design [[T4T Season Two]]. 

We got some enthusiastic responses from individuals, but we didn't light the sector on fire, nor did we build a very big audience (which may not be a thing we're aiming for). 

How might we make it better? Here are some thoughts. 

### Share the Hosting

Have multiple hosts, pursuing multiple threads. 

### Use the Tools

Tools for Thinking ought to use Tools for Thinking! A lot! So let's.

In fact, let's leave behind layer after layer of useful materials, building atop the [visionary documents](https://bra.in/2pxbo6) that described the potential that computers offered us. 

### Simplify the Format

Let's take the production value down a notch and not worry about audience size, but instead about utility and accessibility.

### Questions to Answer for the Podcast

- What tools do we want to use to podcast? Other resources? 
- Who is interested in participating? 
	- Jess Martin?
	- Maggie Appleton?
	- John Underkoffler? 
- How should we coordinate?
	- Scheduling on Airtable? Other?
	- Conversations on Discord? Other? 
- Where is the common virtual ground? [The Big Fungus](https://www.thebigfungus.org/)? 
- Instead of producing a podcast *for* people to get literate, how about involving them directly? 
- What computer literacy orgs might be interested?
- What templates/structures do we need so the podcast episodes build well?
- Keep "Tools for Thinking"? Rename it HyperTalk? Something else?
- Where does the main entity live? Who hosts it? 

### Questions to Ponder in the Podcast

- What parts of the early visions have been fulfilled? Which have not materialized?
- How can the early visions improve what we're building now? 
- Why is computer history so white male? Where is the diversity?
- How best to connect computer history to computer literacy?
- How can computer history be made most available? 
- What is the curriculum for computer history? In what sequence should people tackle it?
