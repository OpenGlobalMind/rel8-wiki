# Rethinking the Tools for Thinking Podcast

*To build and nurture a community of practice around tools for thinking, as well as make good thinking more available in the world.*

We're wrapping Season One of the [[Tools for Thinking Podcast]]. This page is to design [[T4T Season Two]]. 

Season One got some enthusiastic responses from individuals, but we didn't light the sector on fire, nor did we build a very big audience (which may not be a thing we're aiming for). 

We have an opportunity to make it better. Here are some thoughts. 

## Build a Hive Mind (vs a single podcast)

### Have Multiple Podcasts and Hosts

We have one existing podcast, [[Tools for Thinking Podcast|Tools for Thinking]], which we can continue producing. That podcast could have multiple hosts, instead of just one. 

We also have ideas for other podcasts with different focal areas. For example, a HyperTalk podcast could focus on the history of computing. 

The idea is to be flexible and creative hosting a community of podcasts with multiple hosts pursuing multiple quests, intersecting and sharing resources a lot. 

### Use the Tools

Tools for Thinking ought to use Tools for Thinking! A lot! So let's.

In fact, let's leave behind layer after layer of useful materials, building atop the [visionary documents](https://bra.in/2pxbo6) that described the potential that computers offered us. 

### Simplify the Format

Let's take the production value down a notch (from Riverside recording back to Zoom, with less editing) and not worry about audience size, but instead about utility and accessibility.

### Podcast Design Questions

- What tools do we want to use to record, edit and distribute the podcast? To post about it? Other resources? 
- How should we coordinate?
	- Scheduling on Airtable? Notion? Other?
	- Conversations on Discord? Other? 
- What roles can people adopt in this community? ([[Ways You Can Participate]])
- Who is interested in participating? 
	- Jess Martin?
	- Maggie Appleton?
	- John Underkoffler? 
- What organizations might be interested?
	- The Internet Archive
	- Hypothes.is
	- [[Open Global Mind]]
	- Computer History Museum
	- What computer literacy orgs might be interested?
- Where is the common virtual ground? [[The Big Fungus]]? [[The Betterverse]]?
- Build diversity in from the start
- Instead of producing a podcast *for* people to get literate, how about involving them directly? 
- What templates/structures do we need so the podcast episodes build well?
- Keep "Tools for Thinking"? Rename it HyperTalk? Something else? (here's a [[T4T Venn Diagram]]?)
	- [[HyperTalk]] (community? podcast? metalabel?)
	- Tools for Thinking (T4T)
	- [[Weaving the World]] (WtW)
	- [[The Big Fungus]]
	- others...
- Where does the main entity live? Who hosts it? 

### Potential Podcast Episode Topics (for Notion)

- What parts of the early visions have been fulfilled? Which have not materialized?
- How can the early visions improve what we're building now? 
- Why is computer history so white male? Where is the diversity?
- How best to connect computer history to computer literacy?
- How can computer history be made most available? 
- What is the curriculum for computer history? In what sequence should people tackle it?
- How do we build a thriving ecosystem here, mixing businesses and the Commons?
- What happens when startups fail?
	- Analyze HyperCard

### Potential Podcast Guests (for Notion)

- Dan'l Lewin, director of the Computer History Museum
- Eric Rangell, who has been experimenting with Ted Nelson's ZigZag
- Eric Eugene Kim, who worked with Engelbart for years
- Adele Goldberg, creator of Smalltalk
- Tech-historian bloggers and podcasters
- Chris Aldrich, who knows this history well 
- David Vargas, SamePage
- Sam Arbesman
