# Shorts to Revitalize Cities

[[Revitalizing Cities]] is part of [[Storytelling of What Works]], which is based on the idea that [[Storytelling + Relationships + Resources = Lasting Change]].

This Shorts [playlist is here](); the individual videos (with added resources) are:

- [[Build an edible landscape!]]
- [[Pretend it exists!]]
- [[Curitiba's rebirth]]

Each Short is woven into its context in [[Jerry's Brain]], [here](https://bra.in/9qaErm).
