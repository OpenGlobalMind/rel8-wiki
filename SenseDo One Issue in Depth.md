# SenseDo One Issue in Depth

[[Open Global Mind]] focuses on [[multiplayer sensemaking]]. We've done a lot of talking, some collaborating and some coding, but some participants are (rightly) impatient to get more done. So we coined [[SenseDoing]]. 

This project is to SenseDo one topic, in depth, adding it to [[The Big Fungus]].



Candidate topics: 

- Covid Vaccination
- How Would a Healthy Society Handle a Pandemic?
- Converting Offices to Apartments
- 

Potential participants: 

- [[Jerry Michalski]], convener
- [[Rob O'Keefe]]
- [[Marc-Antoine Parent]]
